> ⚠️ This is the development branch. Check out the [master branch](https://github.com/vegeta897/d-zone/tree/master) for a working release.

## Concept

**D-Zone** is a graphical simulation meant to abstractly represent the activity in your Discord server.

This is not meant for any actual monitoring or diagnostics, only an experiment in the abstraction of chatroom data represented via autonomous characters in a scene.

Hopefully the simulation is interesting to watch. You can see the current (uninteresting) client version simulating the [discord.io server](https://discord.gg/0MvHMfHcTKVVmIGP) here: [pixelatomy.com/dzone](https://pixelatomy.com/dzone/)
